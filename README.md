# Reddit Notification Bot

Simple Reddit bot that searches a single subreddit and notifies a user for certain keywords. Made only for learning purposes and personal usage.

## Usage

To run the bot, first have the prerequisits installed. Download the project from GitHub then open config.py in a text editor and modify it based on the Reddit account that will be used. Once the config file has been modified, run the batch file and if the configurations are correct then the bot will run.
